i'm quaithe, a 16 year old girl from england. i learnt some python at school and it's now my hobby. i really like making text-based games in it, but i'm open to everything really. i love to learn new things so please feel free to tell me new ways of doing stuff. my other hobbies include reading, playing the guitar and piano, listening to music, and art, both traditional and digital.
